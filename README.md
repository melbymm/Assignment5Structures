Bugs: I don't even know where to start. My rollback is shaky at best, I could not, for the life of me, get the program to print out to the files. I managed to continually create myself new bugs every time I tried to debug.

Resources: Class notes, "Data Structures & Algorithms," second edition, By Michael Boodrich.
Collaboration: I had no partner for this asssignment, however, Jessie Smith & I gave each other pointers along the way.
